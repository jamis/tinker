Tinker
======

Tinker is a system for developing simple "choose-your-own-adventure"-style
games. It was inspired by Sarah Allen's "pie" framework.

Tinker should really have never been, except I was sitting in an airport
without Internet access, wishing I could dig into pie, and decided that I'd
see where I could get on a similar system, instead of moping about lost
opportunities.
